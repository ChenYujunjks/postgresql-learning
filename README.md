# PostgreSQL Learning Project

This is a minimal PostgreSQL learning project designed to help you master core PostgreSQL features through raw SQL, with a focus on:

- Differences from MySQL
- Practical use of data types like `uuid`, `timestamptz`, and `jsonb`
- SQL functions and expressions
- Indexes and performance basics
- Row Level Security (RLS)

No ORMs. No frameworks. Just SQL.
